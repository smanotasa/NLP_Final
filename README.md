## Introduction

This project aims to develop text classification models using the `IMDb dataset`. The `IMDb dataset` is a widely used benchmark in natural language processing research, containing a large collection of movie reviews classified as positive or negative. The goal of this project is to explore different machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Recurrent Neural Networks and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, to develop accurate text classification models that can distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews. Additionally, we will evaluate the performance of the models based on several metrics, such precision, recall, and F1 score. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the IMDb Movie Review dataset, which is available in the Hugging Face dataset library. This dataset contains a collection of movie reviews from the IMDb website, classified as positive or negative based on the rating given by the reviewer. The dataset consists of 50,000 reviews, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. Each review is represented as a string of characters and has a corresponding sentiment label of either positive or negative.
