Natural_Language_Processing_DSDM2023_IMDB

This project aims to develop text classification models using the IMDB dataset. The IMDB dataset is a widely used benchmark in natural language processing research, containing a large collection of movie reviews classified as positive or negative. The goal of this project is to explore different machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Recurrent Neural Networks and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, to develop accurate text classification models that can distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews. Additionally, we will evaluate the performance of the models based on several metrics, such precision, recall, and F1 score.
